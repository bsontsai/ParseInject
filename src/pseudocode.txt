define keywords dictionary
define operators dictionary

declare stack for variable naming

open file

strip comments (assume prettifier can strip comments)

for each line in file
    strip strings
    parse the string into tokens with string.split(' ')
    remove all excess spaces

    for each token in line
        if keyword -> {
            push keyword to stack and increment keyword counter in dictionary
            decide if needed to declare static variable
        } else -> {
            go through token character by character and find operator
            if operator -> {
                increment operator counter in dictionary
                write static variable declaration to file
                lines.push(variable++)
